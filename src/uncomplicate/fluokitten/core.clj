(defn fmap
  "Applies a function f to the value(s) inside functor's context
   while preserving the context. More about Functors can be found
   in the doc for uncomplicate.fluokitten.protocols/Functor.

   Returns a functor instance consisting of the result of applying f
   to the value(s) inside the functor's context. Vararg version applies
   f to value(s) provided by the functors' contexts. If called with only
   one argument, lifts function f so it can be applied to functor,
   i.e creates a new function that can reach inside the functor's
   context and return the result of applying the original function f.

   fmap can be thought of in two ways:
   1. As a function that takes a function f and functor and then maps
      the function over the functor value. In this sense, it is similar
      to ubiquitous map function, with the difference that fmap works
      on any Functor instance and it preserves the context type (while
      map always converts its source to a sequence).
   2. As a function that takes a function f so it can operate on functor
      values instead on plain values.

   Function f should work on plain values without regard to the functor.
   Functor must be an extension of Functor protocol and MUST satisfy
   the functor laws
   (see the doc for uncomplicate.fluokitten.protocols/Functor)

   Some common Clojure constructs that are Functors:
   - persistent collections
   - reducibles
   - functions
   - nil
   - atoms, refs
   - strings
   - keywords
   - all Objects. (fmap f o) equals (f o) if nothing more specific has
     been defined for object's type

   ---- Example 1: Clojure collections are functors

   (fmap str [1 2 3])
   => [\"1\" \"2\" \"3\"]

   Since clojure vector is a functor, it represents a context for its
   elements. Function inc works on the elements of the vector, and
   does not know anything about the vector itself. The result is a
   vector of transformed elements.

   ---- Example 2: Clojure functions are functors

   ((fmap str +) 1 2 3)
   => \"6\"

   In this example, + is a context for its arguments. fmapping str
   function over + functor (which is also a function), we get another
   function that applies string to an argument, but with the context of
   incrementing preserved.

   ---- Example 3: lifting a function
   ((fmap str) [1 2 3])
   => [\"1\" \"2\" \"3\"]

   Returns an applicative functor instance consisting of
   the result of applying the function(s) inside af's context

   applies the function(s) inside af to the value(s)
